Your job is to create a calculator which evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation.

For example expression 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 - (which is equivalent to 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3 in normal notation) should evaluate to 14.

For your convenience, the input is formatted such that a space is provided between every token.

Empty expression should evaluate to 0.

Valid operations are +, -, *, /.

You may assume that there won't be exceptional situations (like stack underflow or division by zero).




function calc(expr) {
  let tokens = expr.split(/\s/);
  let token;
  let stack = [];
  let signs = {
    '+': (a, b) => b + a,
    '*': (a, b) => b * a,
    '-': (a, b) => b - a,
    '/': (a, b) => b / a
  };
  let last;
  
  while (token = tokens.shift()) {
    if (signs[token]) {
      stack.push(last = signs[token](stack.pop(), stack.pop()));
    } else {
      stack.push(last = +token);
    }
  }
  
  return last || 0;
}
